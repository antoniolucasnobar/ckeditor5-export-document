CKEditor 5 Export Document feature
============================

This package implements Export Document support for CKEditor 5.

It could be called poor's man export, as it is not as good as the CKEditor5 implementation.

Right now, it only supports RTF conversion using html-to-rtf-browser. More to come.

You can add other conversions using the editor configuration. Just provide a callback to produce the conversion and you are done.
